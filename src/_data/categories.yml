    Safety pad extends 4" above the crotch on each thigh to provide
    critical coverage to large artery areas of the upper leg (standardsz
    dictate only crotch-to-ankle coverage).

    Contoured high back to fit comfortably into the lower back area to
    keep saw dust out and kidney area warm.

    Triple the amount of bartacking available from other manufacturers
    to provide strength in high stress areas. (eight bartacks in crotch
    area alone!)

    Only the highest quality nickel plated brass, solid brass fasteners
    and zippers are used.

    Distinctive high visibility red or gold pocket flaps give an added
    margin of safety to the user.
