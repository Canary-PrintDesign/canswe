    For over 30 years, Can-Swe has been providing guaranteed safety, backed by family dedication which
    continues today. After representing Canada at the World Championship Competition for Loggers in 1970,
    Wayne LeBlanc, of British Columbia had a vision of improving the safety of BC’s foresters. As the
    importance for safety heightened both locally and provincially, audiences were looking for increased
    safety when working in the great outdoors.

    With the commercial introduction of Dupont Kevlar, Can-Swe developed and introduced Kevlar reinforced
    safety pants that would become an industry leader and standard. Stronger, lighter and cooler than their
    predecessor, Can-Swe introduced a technology that would change the industry.

    The legacy endures as the Payer family, Calvin and Danielle, continue to demonstrate Can-Swes’ values, integrity and dedication to safety.
