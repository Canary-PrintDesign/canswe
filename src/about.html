        The Hurricane jacket has been a great purchase for the BC Rap Attack... Our firefighters are safer, and can operate in a greater range of conditions.
        Our crew is happier and safer with CANSWE

      One thing I learned during my 15-year career as a feller in the commercial logging industry 
      was that good chainsaw garments were either overpriced, offered too little protection, or both!
      CAN-SWE is my attempt to create affordable protective equipment that was safer and more durable than 
      what was on the
      <span>
        market.
